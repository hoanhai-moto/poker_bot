right now I have a desktop running poker game with window environment I need to create an application using AI to play poker here is         how                                                                                                                                       
  it's work . User will provide the window where the poker window present                                                                      
  then user will guild you where the button should click like check , fold , and raise and if raise how many BB to be raise , then you     
  will                                                                                                                                       
  take screen shot of that poker window -> forward to AI -> Ai will return Json -> perform action . plan to implement for me . Note the        
  raise                                                                                                                                        
  action might be contain multiple step like select field,then delete the original value ,then perform raise                                   
  and they will have to write down a log of action of players  to analyze their play style  and base on that also to give the correct          
  action                                                                                                                                       
  . Also to perform action you will have also to detect if it's your turn or not or the other player still action .                            
  Plan really detail for me ask me as many question, you can ask many thing to implement best out of it ,Create from srcacth
